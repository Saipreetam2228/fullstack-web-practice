## HTML Code Description

This HTML file is designed as a complete demonstration of core HTML functionality and commonly used elements. It showcases how different HTML tags work together to build a structured and interactive web page.

### 1. Document Structure
- Uses `<!DOCTYPE html>` to declare an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` tag defines the root of the document with language set to English.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings for responsiveness, and the page title.

### 2. Page Layout Sections
- `<header>` defines the top section of the page, displaying the main heading and introductory text.
- `<nav>` provides internal navigation links that allow users to jump to specific sections of the page.
- `<section>` elements are used to divide the content logically into meaningful parts.
- `<footer>` contains copyright information and a link to return to the top of the page.

### 3. Text Formatting Features
- Demonstrates text styling using tags such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<mark>`.
- Uses `<sub>` and `<sup>` to represent subscript and superscript text.
- Includes `<small>` to show reduced font size text.

### 4. List Implementation
- Unordered lists (`<ul>`) are used to display bullet-point items.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) show numbered items.
- Description lists (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`) are used to define terms and their meanings.

### 5. Image and Hyperlink Usage
- The `<img>` tag is used to display an image with specified width, height, and alternative text.
- Anchor tags (`<a>`) create hyperlinks, including external links that open in a new browser tab.

### 6. Table Representation
- The `<table>` element is used to organize data in rows and columns.
- Includes table headers (`<th>`), table data cells (`<td>`), and a `<caption>` for describing the table content.

### 7. Form Functionality
- Demonstrates user input handling using `<form>`.
- Includes text and email input fields.
- Uses radio buttons for single-choice selection.
- Uses checkboxes for multiple-choice selection.
- Includes a dropdown menu (`<select>`) for selecting options.
- Uses a `<textarea>` for multi-line text input.
- Submit and reset buttons allow form interaction.

### 8. Styling and Responsiveness
- Inline CSS is applied to the `<body>` to set font and background color.
- The viewport meta tag ensures the page adapts to different screen sizes.

### Purpose of the File
This file is intended for educational and lab practice purposes. It helps beginners understand how different HTML elements function and how they combine to create a complete, structured web page.
